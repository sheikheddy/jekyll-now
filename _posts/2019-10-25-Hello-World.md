Welcome to my new blog! I'll be porting stuff from my old one here soon. Until then, here's a picture of the mandelbrot set:

While you're here, make sure to check out [my CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv.pdf). 

I've been meaning to make a personal webiste for quite some time, but I always overcomplicated it and got nowhere. This attempt was finally successful mostly because

A. It's a static site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Doesn't get much simpler than this. 
B. I was procrastinating on something more important (the most powerful force known to man).
